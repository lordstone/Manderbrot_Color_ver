//UPDATE: changed color generation to a more beautiful one

compile all and run from myManderactal.
You can use arrow keys to move and enter/space to zoom in/out.
I did not follow the basic version because the extra array is not necessary.
The default output PPM directory is "C:\temp\temp.ppm". Everytime you move or zoom the old one will be replaced by the new one.

If you want, you can goto Manderbrot.java to change the parameters, such as power of the z complex number or the threshold of escaping, lots of fun!!

Enjoy!
